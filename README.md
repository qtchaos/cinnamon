# Cinnamon

Simple and lightweight streaming server with support for mega.nz files and sequential video chunk streaming.

## Warning

This project is still in development and is not ready for production use, use at your own risk.

mega.nz allows a maximum of 5GB of transfer per day without an account per IP, will need to implement proxies or something similar to bypass this limit.

##### Mostly proof of concept, no plans for full release.
